	change weights between output and hidden
	
		output sum margin of error = target - calculated

		Delta output sum  = S'(sum) * output sum margin of error
		where sum = sum of inputs to output layer multiplied by weights
		sum = product of hidden layer results and weights between hidden layer and output layer

		change in weights = delta weights

		delta weights = delta output sum / hidden layer outputs
		apply delta weights to weights

	change weights between hidden and input

		

		Delta hidden sum = delta output sum / hidden-to-outer weights * S'(hidden sum)	
		delta output sum taken from before
		hidden sum = product of input and weights between hidden and input

		delta weights = delta hidden sum / input data
